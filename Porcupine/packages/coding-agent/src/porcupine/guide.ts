		title: "Everyday Workflow",
		summary: "Use plain language for work. Porcupine routes tools and skills for clear requests.",
		steps: [
			"Ask for a concrete result, such as a fix, review, test run, or explanation.",
			"For larger work, ask for a plan first or use /plan <objective>.",

		id: "modes",
		title: "Interaction Modes",
		summary: "Modes choose how tool actions are approved. Reasoning settings remain separate.",

		summary: "Delegate focused work to an isolated worker with its own context and budgets.",

			"Use the subagent tool for self-contained work: long research, refactors, audits, drafts.",
			"Give an exact task: input paths, the deliverable, and where to put it. Add notes for constraints.",

			"Use /goal <objective> for a bounded, persistent session goal.",

		title: "Research and Documentation",
		summary: "Search first, then inspect a concrete source. Keep claims grounded.",

		title: "Memory and Learning",
		summary: "Porcupine retains only durable, evidence-backed knowledge and recovery skills.",

		summary: "Sessions preserve work. Branching and compaction manage history without losing the active goal.",

			"Use /compact when the context needs a deliberate summary.",

		summary: "Extend the agent at the edges with settings, skills, prompts, themes, packages, and extensions.",
